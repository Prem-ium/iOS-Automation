# Archived Projects (No Longer Maintained)
The following scripts are not being regularly updated or maintained, they may still work but are operating as a 'best attempt'

#### Taco Bell
Automate the creation of a brand new Taco Bell Rewards account, which provides the benefit of receiving 'new user' coupons and freebie meals on sign-up. Paired extremely well when used with Jailbreak tweaks such as Slices to create multiple accounts to receive the best possible amount of new user promotions. This script must be executed using [AutoTouch](https://autotouch.net/). 

#### Stock Brokerage Automation
Automate brokerage stock orders on multiple different brokerages to buy the same specified stock ticker across multiple accounts. Although this is no longer maintained, I am actively building a project named [Auto-StockTrader](https://github.com/Prem-ium/Auto-StockTrader) which accomplishes this same task on a larger scale, through the use of Selenium IDE on PC. 

This script must be executed using [AutoTouch](https://autotouch.net/). 

#### SHEIN
Automate 'Daily Check-In" in Rewards page to earn daily points. This script must be executed using [AutoTouch](https://autotouch.net/).
