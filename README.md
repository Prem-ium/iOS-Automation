My personal collection of [AutoTouch](https://autotouch.net/), [Sciptable](https://scriptable.app/), and other automation scripts to automate tasks on mobile.

## Scripts Included:
### Govee Lights & Social
Two seperate scripts.

`GoveeAutomation.js`- AutoTouch Script to automate daily tasks that earn rewards. Requires the first album in photos app to be full of Govee videos to upload. Script automates daily comment on video, comment on post, and daily video upload to earn Govee points which can be redeemed for Govee Lights, Products, & Rewards.

`PowerToggle-Govee-API.js`- Scriptable script that utilizes the Govee API to toggle the power on/off of any supported device.

## Taco Bell
Using AutoTouch, automate the creation of a brand new Taco Bell Rewards account, which provides the benefit of receiving coupons and freebie meals on sign-up. Paired extremely well when used with Jailbreak tweaks such as Slices to create a number of accounts to receive the best possible new user promotions.

### Auto RSA
(Archived, No longer maintained)
An auto-touch script that automated the purchase and sale of any user specified stock ticker across multiple stock brokerage(s) on iPhone. Although this is no longer maintained and used, I am actively working to contribute to a new repository I've created named [Auto-StockTrader](https://github.com/Prem-ium/Auto-StockTrader)  which accomplishes this same task, through the use of Selenium IDE on PC. 

### SHEIN
An auto-touch script which attempts to check-in to the SHEIN application to gain the daily point(s) reward.
