# RSA - Stock-Brokerage-Automation

Automate the purchase of a stock ticker across multiple different brokerages.

This program initiates an auto-touch program, streamlining the setup process to the order page, where manual intervention is required to prevent errors.

Currently, Robinhood is the only fully implemented platform, with improvements forthcoming, while SoFi and Public are in progress. ~~Additional platforms will be integrated gradually.~~
