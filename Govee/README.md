# Govee Points Automation
### About
`GoveeAutomation.js` allows a user to automate the daily tasks that earn you user points on the Govee platform. There are multiple features including automated:
- Video & Topic Commenting (Plus liking/engaging, extra bonus points)
- Video Uploading
- User Engagement (Liking & browsing topic posts)
- Roughly 24-26 daily points can be automated daily. An extra 20 points can be made by making a simple topic post, coming out to 44-46 points per day with minimum effort.
